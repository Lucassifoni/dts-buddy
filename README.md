# dts-buddy
Research on a device tree source buddy to help people compile &amp; load DTBOs at runtime in Elixir

## Rpi-world "dtoverlay"

see https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/configuration.html#part3.5

The dtoverlay binary seems to be a good starting point of the abilities a DTS buddy should give :

```
Usage:
  dtoverlay <overlay> [<param>=<val>...]
                           Add an overlay (with parameters)
  dtoverlay -D [<idx>]     Dry-run (prepare overlay, but don't apply -
                           save it as dry-run.dtbo)
  dtoverlay -r [<overlay>] Remove an overlay (by name, index or the last)
  dtoverlay -R [<overlay>] Remove from an overlay (by name, index or all)
  dtoverlay -l             List active overlays/params
  dtoverlay -a             List all overlays (marking the active)
  dtoverlay -h             Show this usage message
  dtoverlay -h <overlay>   Display help on an overlay
  dtoverlay -h <overlay> <param>..  Or its parameters
    where <overlay> is the name of an overlay or 'dtparam' for dtparams
Options applicable to most variants:
    -d <dir>    Specify an alternate location for the overlays
                (defaults to /boot/firmware/overlays or /flash/overlays)
    -v          Verbose operation
```

> Removing an overlay will not cause a loaded module to be unloaded, but it may cause the reference count of some modules to drop to zero. Running rmmod -a twice will cause unused modules to be unloaded.
> Overlays have to be removed in reverse order. The commands will allow you to remove an earlier one, but all the intermediate ones will be removed and re-applied, which may have unintended consequences.
> Only Device Tree nodes at the top level of the tree and children of a bus node will be probed. For nodes added at run-time there is the further limitation that the bus must register for notifications of the addition and removal of children. However, there are exceptions that break this rule and cause confusion: the kernel explicitly scans the entire tree for some device types - clocks and interrupt controller being the two main ones - in order to (for clocks) initialise them early and/or (for interrupt controllers) in a particular order. This search mechanism only happens during booting and so doesnâ€™t work for nodes added by an overlay at run-time. It is therefore recommended for overlays to place fixed-clock nodes in the root of the tree unless it is guaranteed that the overlay will not be used at run-time.
